# Final Project for ANN Implementation
This project is a final project for Intelligent systems course.
Its an application of the ANN-LSTM Model for Early student performance

## Requirements
- Python
- Pandas
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Sklearn
- MatplotLib
- GTK
- Numpy

## Steps to run application
Grab a copy of the source code from [here](https://github.com/DanielOkyere/ann_project_implementation)

Grab a copy of the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S5_k1VPA_U5mX1B7ac_ZxSjw18N1QA-p/view). 

Kindly note the dataset is compressed.

When it is unpacked can reach up to 2GiG. 

So be sure to reduce the datasize in order for the application to work with the data locally.

Once project is cloned, execute :
```bash
cd ann_project_implementation/work
python3 -m pip install -r requirement.txt
./app.py
```
